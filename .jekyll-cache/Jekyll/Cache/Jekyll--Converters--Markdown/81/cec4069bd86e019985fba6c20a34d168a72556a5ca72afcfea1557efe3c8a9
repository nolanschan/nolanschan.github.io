I"g	<h1 id="about">About</h1>

<p>Hello! I’m Nolan. I just graduated with a BSEE (Controls concentration) from California State University, Long Beach in May, 2022. Coming from an arts/music background and picking up a fascination with psychology along the way before transitioning to engineering, I’m passionate about science/technology, design, people, and fields where they intersect. My curiosity drives my interest in learning about, well, basically anything and everything. But I would particularly love to work with robotics, AI, machine learning, human-computer interaction, and space exploration.</p>

<p>My other hobbies include reading (books as well as following down the Wikipedia rabbit hole), photography, traveling, food, and horticulture (particularly bonsais, but I’m planning to expand to hydro/aquaponics one of these days). Oh, and hanging out with my dog.</p>
