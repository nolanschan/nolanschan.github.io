<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p></p>

<p>Part 1 of Benchtop Labs for Digital Control course.</p>

<p>The purpose of this lab experiment is to model a satellite in the analog domain as a double integrator using op amps. As a double integrator is inherently unstable, an analog controller must be added to the system. In this experiment, a lead compensator is to be used as the controller for this system.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>Overall, the circuit worked as intended, but was very slow. This meant that the controller was only able to function at a very low frequency. It is possible that this was due to the fact that a single-supply op-amp was used.</p>

Rise time: ~2s <br />
Settling time: ~7.5s <br />
Percent overshoot: 23%</p>

<p>It should be noted that due to technical issues with the oscilloscope probes, the amplitude shown are ~10x the actual value.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Though this analog circuit design fulfilled its overall purpose of implementing a double integrator plant, as well as a lead compensator to control the unstable double integrator signal, the slow speed of its response was a major deficiency, limiting the frequencies at which the circuit can serve its function. In future design iterations, changing from the use of single-supply op amps to dual-supply op amps could be a significant step towards improving the performance of the circuit.</p>
