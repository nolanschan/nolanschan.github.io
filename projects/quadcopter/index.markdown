### Project Overview ###
> For our senior capstone design course, our group decided to build a quadcopter. None of us knew much about quadcopters in general, but we thought it would be a cool project and a good learning experience. As electrical engineers, our focus was on the control system -- the flight controller, rather than the actual quadcopter. Our goal was to use commercially-available parts to build a quadcopter which would be capable of self-stabilization.  

### Design Process ###
> As initial design requirements, we decided to build a quadcopter in the X-configuration, as it is the easiest to balance and control. We also decided to use an Arduino UNO as our flight controller since it was something we all had worked with in some way, shape, or form. Since none of us knew much about selecting quadcopter components, we began by looking into build kits. However, we quickly found that most of them were either beyond our budget and/or meant to be used with manufactured/pre-programmed flight controller chips, which would defeat the purpose of our project.

> After further research, we made our initial purchases, which included a 220mm wheelbase carbon fiber frame (with 5030 propellers), a set of 2300kV brushless DC motors,  electronic speed controllers, an MPU6050 IMU chip, a LiPo battery (+ charger), and a 6-channel digital radio control system.

### Initial Testing and Design Adjustments ###
> Upon assembling and testing our quadcopter, we found that it was too heavy! It took almost full throttle for our vehicle to start lifting, and it seemed off-balance. In our inexperience, we had neglected to properly account for the weight of all the components together! Oops. Going back to the drawing board, we decided to use a smaller battery, trading battery-life for less weight. We also opted for 3-blade propellers, which would help generate more lift.
