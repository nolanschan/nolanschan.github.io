Project Einstein VR is a start-up that builds motion simulators for location-based entertainment and education venues.

I met Dr. Curt Platt (who builds these things out of his garage!) at a STEAM career expo a few years ago, when I was still in community college. He was kind enough to let me help out with some of his projects, even though I didn't know much at the time. I can take very little credit, especially when it comes to the technical aspects. But with my background in themed entertainment and ride operation, I was able to make some contributions with proposing design ideas, as well as assessing designs for potential safety and operational concerns. I also assisted with prototype manufacturing and user testing.
