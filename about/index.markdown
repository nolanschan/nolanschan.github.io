# About #

Hello! I'm Nolan. I just graduated with a BSEE (Controls concentration) from California State University, Long Beach in May, 2022. Coming from an arts/music background and picking up a fascination with psychology along the way before transitioning to engineering, I'm passionate about science/technology, design, people, and fields where they intersect. My curiosity drives my interest in learning about, well, basically anything and everything. But I would particularly love to work with robotics, AI, machine learning, human-computer interaction, and space exploration. 

My other hobbies include reading (books as well as following down the Wikipedia rabbit hole), photography, traveling, food, and horticulture (particularly bonsais, but I'm planning to expand to hydro/aquaponics one of these days). Oh, and hanging out with my dog.
