# About #

Hello! I'm Nolan. I have a BSEE (Controls concentration) from California State University, Long Beach, and I'm currently working in the aerospace industry, in Radiation and Survivability Engineering. Primarily I'm a Radiation Effects Test Engineer, but I also occasionally work as a Radiation Effects Analyst, in an effort to better understand the data I take and its impact on the design/system.

Before aerospace, my work experience has mainly been in themed entertainment. It was one of my inspirations for going back to school to study Engineering, and will always be something I love. Right now I'm focused on developing my skills and expanding my technical knowledge as an engineer, while I find something that I love more than anything else, to pursue an advanced degree for.

Coming from an arts/music background and picking up a fascination with psychology along the way before transitioning to engineering, I'm passionate about science/technology, design, people, and fields where they intersect. While I'm proud to be someone who will enthusiastically learn about pretty much anything and everything, I'm particularly interested in robotics, controls and automation, AI, machine learning, human-machine interaction, sustainable technology, and space exploration. For now I'm concentrating on my career, but I hope to continue this habit of detailed documentation as I work on personal projects to learn more about these topics.

My other hobbies include reading (books as well as following down the Wikipedia rabbit hole), photography, traveling, food, and horticulture (particularly bonsais, but I'm planning to expand to hydro/aquaponics when I have more space).
