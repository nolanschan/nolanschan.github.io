Well it's certainly been a long journey, but we've finally come to the end! Final projects and exams are done; now just to wait for that degree to be conferred. In the meantime, updates are still happening for some past projects, as well as my most-recent ones that were just completed.

I was thinking the other day about the text game that I wrote for my C++ class a few years ago and never finished completely (since the requirement was only one room). I periodically thought about finishing it, but I actually haven't been able to find it haha. Not sure if I left it on an external drive somewhere or I somehow didn't copy it over when I got a new laptop. But, since I'm trying to learn more Python, I think I'm going to try and make a new text game. Last time I had to do it within the time constraint of a class, so I didn't really get to flush out a system or a good story. But this time since I'm doing it for myself, I'll be able to plan it out first. So that should be a fun project to keep me occupied in between those job applications!
