Guess I can finally call myself an engineer now. :] 

Just some minor updates this time. Once I'm settled with work, I'm hoping to start working on some personal projects related to some of the things that I'm interested in. I'm planning to keep using this as a portfolio for those projects, so I can continue this habit of doing detailed documentation.

Til next time!
