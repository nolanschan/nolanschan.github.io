Hello! It's been a while since I've put together a portfolio, but I'm excited to have a place to track all the things I've done (and will do). It's also been interesting relearning some HTML and CSS so I can change some of the layout elements haha.

I'm still in the process of adding old projects, and of course will be updating with new projects as they're ready. I'm also hoping I can use this place to keep track of any interesting references that I come across. Still not sure if I'll use this as an actual blog, but we shall see!

In any case, welcome! Feel free to look around!
